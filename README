This are the initial steps of my dissertation project that aims to predict fluid flow in porous media. Here you can find my attemps to define a new architecture based on Inception.

My initial work is inspired on the MS-NET (link here: https://github.com/je-santos/ms_net).

Content:

config.json:

    Fill the content to match your folders structure:

    "LBPM_IO_folder": Main folder of LBM simulations
    "NN_dataset_folder": Main folder of .pt datasets
    "NN_model_weights_folder": Main folder of trained model weights
    "Rock_shape": Domain shape [Depth(Channels), Hight(Row), Lenght(Columns)]
    "LBPM_installation_folder": Main folder of LBPM installation

    ALL PATHS MUST END WITH '/'
environment.yml:

    Environment dependencies, use it to create conda.

main_create_StochasticPlane.py:

    Create domains and save into .raw

main_create_Simulations.py:

    Read .raw data and run LBPM to create simulations as .vti

main_create_Dataset.py:

    Read and concatenate .vti files as Dataset .pt
