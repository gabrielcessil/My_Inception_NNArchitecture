This are the initial steps of my dissertation project that aims to predict fluid flow in porous media. Here you can find my attemps to define a new architecture based on Inception.

My initial work is inspired on the MS-NET (link here: https://github.com/je-santos/ms_net).

To save time on initial validations, the current state of my work is trying to overfit one single LBM simulation.
